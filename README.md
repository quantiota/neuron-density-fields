# 3D 4D 5D coherent neuron density fields using Simplex noise


This repository provides ready-to-use scripts and figures for constructing spatially coherent neuron density fields in 3D, 4D, and 5D using Simplex noise.

The goal is simple: to offer a constructible, high-dimensional density substrate with smooth, bounded gradients that can be used in neural field models, geometric learning frameworks, and brain-inspired systems.

For neuroscientists, the density fields reflect heterogeneous neuron distributions consistent with known cytoarchitectonic variability.
For physicists, they define a continuous field whose gradients can enter metric tensors and geometric dynamics.
For AI researchers, they provide a non-uniform substrate on which learning, routing, or geodesic computation can be explored beyond fixed architectures.

All figures in this repository are generated directly from the scripts and illustrate how spatial coherence is preserved as dimension increases from 3D to 5D.
